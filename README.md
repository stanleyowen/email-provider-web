# Web-based Email Service Provider Setup

Setting up a web-based email service provider involves creating an environment that facili-tates seamless communication between web clients and email protocols such as SMTP and IMAP. This configuration ensures that the service can send, receive, and manage emails efficiently while providing a user-friendly interface accessible through a browser.

The web-based approach leverages modern technologies, including web servers, client-side scripting, and robust libraries for protocol management. This setup offers scalability, accessibil-ity, and integration with existing systems. This document outlines the essential prerequisites and configuration steps for preparing the web environment to support email services. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure a robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure for their web-based email solution.

## Windows Operating System

1. Application Setup

   a. To ensure efficient coding and development, it is essential to set up a suitable text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Vim. Visual Studio Code is particularly recommended for this setup due to its versatility, user-friendly interface, and robust support for modern web and email-related technologies. The installation package for Visual Studio Code can be accessed at https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

   b. NodeJS and NPM are essential for the development of the application. NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. NPM is a package manager for NodeJS that allows developers to install and manage packages and dependencies. The installation package for NodeJS and NPM can be accessed at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

2. Downloading the Project

   a. To download the project, navigate to the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/stanleyowen/email-provider-web
   b. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the project files to your local machine.
   c. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a suitable location on your machine.
   d. Open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor/IDE.

3. Setting Up the Server Application
   a. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code or your text editor/IDE and navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd path/to/project
   ```

   b. Navigate to the server directory within the project folder:

   ```
    cd server
   ```

   c. Install the `yarn` and `nodemon` packages globally on your machine using the following commands:

   ```
   npm install -g yarn nodemon
   ```

   d. Install the project dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

   e. After the installation is complete, start the server using the following command:

   ```
   nodemon
   ```

   f. The server should start running on http://localhost:3000/. You can now access the server API and interact with the email service provider backend.

4. Setting Up the Client Application
   a. Navigate to the client directory within the project folder:
   ```
   cd client
   ```
   b. Install the project dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
   c. After the installation is complete, start the development server using the following command:
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
   d. The application should open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3001/. You can now access the web-based email service provider interface and interact with the application.
